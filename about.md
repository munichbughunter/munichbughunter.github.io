I'm a quality engineer, serverless enthusiast, and Open-Source developer living near Munich. 

You can find me on GitHub, and LinkedIn. 

I joined Pro7 in 2019 as Chief Architect for Testautomation and help build up and grow their test automation and culture. 

Before that, I worked for companies from different industries such as Eurolog, Capgemini (Sogeti), MaibornWolff.
